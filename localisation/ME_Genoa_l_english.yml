The Jewish community was divided among those who prayed according to the Sephardi, Ashkenazi and Romaniote rites. The different traditions were united into a distinctive Krymchak prayer book, which represented the Romaniote rite by Rabbi Moshe Ha-Golah, a Chief Rabbi of Kiev, who had settled in Crimea."

A fleet sent from Venice under Lorenzo Tiepolo in 1257 defeated a Genoese fleet off Acre when it arrived in June the next year. \nCenturies after we laugh over the claims of the Doge and those low level infamous that call themselves merchants. While they were focusing so much on the Mediterranean routes we were able to establish a direct and safe route until India, finally channelling all the spices in the safest port of the world, the one of Zena!"

In Sardinia Sassari became a confederate commune to the Genoese republic in 1294; always in the north-west of the island settled the Doria, who boasted some kinship ties with the judges of Torres, who founded centers such as Alghero and Castelgenovese."
 gen_italian_trade_title: "Italian Trade"
 gen_italian_trade_desc: "The foreign policy of the Republic of Genoa, from the dawn of the year one thousand and along the slow running of the Middle Ages, up to the threshold of the modern era, was mainly that of guaranteeing citizens - outside the borders of Genoa and in projection of overseas territories - a dense network of merchant routes. \nIt was pursued by a consolidated ruling class, at the same time as pragmatic as it was aware of itself and its power. This policy was mainly based on the acquisition and control of new territories - which later became the so-called Genoese colonies - but also on the simple presence in the port cities located along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea and outside it."

But also within the walls of Constantinople there was a Genoese quarter."
 gen_urbs_custoditas_deo_title: "Urbs Custoditas Deo"
 gen_urbs_custoditas_deo_desc: "The Genoese colonies on the Bosphorus were few but important. The most important was the neighborhood of Galata and Pera, beyond the Golden Horn. "Galata" and "Pera" are almost synonymous expressions, but sometimes used in pairs: "Galata and Pera". By its nature close to the city of Constantinople but outside its walls and indeed separated by the Golden Horn, this urban area was intended for the "Franks" that is to the Latin Christians, mostly Genoese and Venetians, and enjoyed administrative autonomy, as it was managed by the consuls of the two Republics. Galata was Genoese since 1273. \nThe neighborhood is dominated by the Galata Tower, rebuilt by the Genoese as the Tower of Christ after the Fourth Crusade and survived to the present day. \nFurthermore, within the walls of Constantinople, but in front of Galata, there was a Genoese district, which, moreover, did not enjoy any autonomy."
