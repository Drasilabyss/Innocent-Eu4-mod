 #Events
 ME_Hormuz_Events.EVTNAME1: "Fate of the House of Nabhan" 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.EVTDESC1: "Established in 1154, the royal lineage of the Nabhani ruled over the western tip of the Persian straits. Famous for their wealth, they controlled the valuable trade of frankincense from the old coasts of Masqat through the Arabian deserts of Sohar. The fate of a brotherly House is in our hands, and the way we choose to deal with such an enormous matter may yet influence our fate and the future of our own people." 
 ME_Hormuz_Events1.EVTOPT1: "Their men of faith will be of great use." 
 ME_Hormuz_Events1.EVTOPT2: "Let us reunite our Houses!"
 ME_Hormuz_Events1.EVTOPT3: "We will make an example of them."
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.EVTNAME2: "Proper Interpretation of Islamic Teachings"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.EVTDESC2: "Dire times have withered the faith of our people by spreading false teachings that go against the Sunni scriptures of our forefathers. Despite that, many amongst the peasantry have not only embraced Ibadi teachings but also plea with local men of state to do so as well.\nClassical Ibadi theologians have stated that only the ahl al-istiqamah will go to paradise, and that all sinning Ibadis as well as all non-Ibadis will burn in hell forever. Ibadis traditionally reject Sunni beliefs that all Muslims in hell will eventually enter paradise, and hold that hell is eternal and inescapable for all humans who were not righteous Ibadis in life. Whatever branch of Islam we decide to follow, our conviction needs to be strong and our faith unshakable, lest we betray Allah and fall pray on our enemies."
 ME_Hormuz_Events2.EVTOPT1: "Ibadi scholars speak of the truth!"
 ME_Hormuz_Events2.EVTOPT2: "We can't abandon the teachings of Sunnism!" 
 
 ME_Hormuz_Events.EVTNAME3: "The Fate of our Kingdom"
 ME_Hormuz_Events.EVTDESC3: "Flavor text about the roots and beginnings of the Kingdom of Hormuz, their pirate past versus their current status as guardians of the straits and famous as well as profitable traders."
 ME_Hormuz_Events3.EVTOPT1: "Let us reignite the burning passion for plunder in our hearts!" 
 ME_Hormuz_Events3.EVTOPT2: "Our future lies with our maritime activities"
